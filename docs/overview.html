    <div class="sectionbody">
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>AgREST is a set of tools to build web APIs for your data. You would use it to expose a data store
                (such as a relational database) as a RESTful web service. To achieve that
                goal AgREST defines a simple HTTP/JSON-based protocol
                (described in <a href="protocol.html">AgREST Protocol</a>) and a server-side framework (described in <a href="framework.html">AgREST Framework</a>).
                The protocol ensures that any client, be it JavaScript, a mobile
                app or maybe a server-side app, can make sense of any AgREST-enabled service. The
                framework is written in Java and helps you to build services adhering to the
                protocol.</p>

    <div class="sectionbody">
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>AgREST is not an automated engine to take your DB online with a single command.
                You still have to write code for JAX-RS endpoints (however simple and trivial that code might end up being).
                Having this code around allows you to customize processing, implement security around endpoints, hide certain methods, etc.
                This is a defensive approach that goes a long way to avoid unintended consequences when opening up your data on the web.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>Having said that, such an engine can be written on top of AgREST with relative ease.</p>

    <div class="sectionbody">
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>AgREST is written on top of <a href="http://cayenne.apache.org">Apache Cayenne ORM</a>
                and supports any relational data store, such as MySQL or Oracle.
                Support for alternative data stores can be provided with relative ease. E.g. NoSQL
                databases, flat files, etc. E.g. we&#8217;ve written POJO and LDAP backends.</p>

    <div class="sectionbody">
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>From the very beginning AgREST was designed with security in mind. It can be easily
                integrated with common web and enterprise security solutions
                (OAuth, <a href="http://shiro.apache.org/">Apache Shiro</a>, Spring Security, etc.),
                giving Java developers a straightforward API to implement custom object and attribute-level access.</p>
