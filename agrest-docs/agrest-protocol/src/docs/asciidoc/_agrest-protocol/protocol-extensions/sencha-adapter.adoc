=== Sencha Adapter

https://github.com/io/agrest/blob/master/agrest/src/main/java/io/agrest/runtime/adapter/sencha/SenchaAdapter.java[SenchaAdapter]
provides a few extensions to the AgREST protocol to better handle certain Sencha features:

* If a to-one relationship property is included in the Collection, the
  framework would also generate a companion "synthetic" FK property called
  "propertyName_id"

* `"filter"` key - an alternative to `"cayenneExp"`.

* `"group"` / `"groupDir"` keys that are functionally equivalent to `"sort"` / `"dir"`.
