== Protocol Extensions

With the help of
https://github.com/io/agrest/blob/master/agrest/src/main/java/io/agrest/runtime/adapter/AgRESTAdapter.java[AgRESTAdapter]
and other AgREST extension techniques one can extend or
customize the protocol to recognize extra control parameters, etc.
AgRESTAdapter ships with one such optional extension that adapts the framework
for the use with Sencha/ExtJS JavaScript client. This extension is described below.
