With the help of
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agrestio/agrest/master/agrest/src/main/java/io/agrest/runtime/adapter/AgAdapter.java[AgAdapter]

customize the protocol to recognize extra control parameters, etc.
`AgAdapter` ships with one such optional extension that adapts the framework
for the use with Sencha/ExtJS JavaScript client. This extension is described below.
