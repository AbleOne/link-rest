=== Running the Application

The goal of this chapter is to run and test our application.
If the steps described above are done, a structure of the project will look like this:

==== Building and running

To build the application use a command `mvn clean install`.

To run a jetty server with our application use a command `mvn jetty:run`

==== Configure IntelliJ IDEA maven plugin

To running using IDE just add a new `Maven` configuration on a menu path `Run -> Edit Configurations...`.
Then set a `Name:` (e.g. *Bookstore*) and a `Command line:` in *jetty:run*

==== Testing

After the application running you may call this endpoint to get a list of categories:

```
curl -i -X GET 'http://localhost:8080/api/category'
```

And get the following response:

[source, JSON]
----
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Wed, 03 Oct 2018 10:14:51 GMT
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 21
Server: Jetty(9.3.14.v20161028)

{"data":[],"total":0}
----

Obviously, the list is empty. So, use a 'POST' command to add some categories:

```
curl -i -X POST 'http://localhost:8080/api/category'  -d '{"id":"1","name":"Science Fiction"}'
```
And one more if it is needed:

```
curl -i -X POST 'http://localhost:8080/api/category' -d '{"id":"2","name":"Horror"}'
```

Response will be:

[source, JSON]
----
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Date: Wed, 03 Oct 2018 10:42:17 GMT
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 16
Server: Jetty(9.3.14.v20161028)

{"success":true}
----

Now make the 'GET' request again and receive the following:

[source, JSON]
----
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Wed, 03 Oct 2018 10:44:44 GMT
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 117

{"data":[{"id":1,"description":null,"name":"Science Fiction"},{"id":2,"description":null,"name":"Horror"}],"total":2}
