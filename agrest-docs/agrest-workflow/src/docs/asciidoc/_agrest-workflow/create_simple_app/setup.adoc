=== Setting up the environment

The goal of this chapter of the tutorial is to install (or check that you already have
installed) a minimally needed set of software to build an Agrest based application.

==== Install Java

Obviously, JDK has to be installed. In this tutorial we use JDK 1.8.

==== Install IntelliJ IDEA

Download and install IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition.
This tutorial is based on version 2016.3, still it should work with any recent IntelliJ IDEA version.

==== The final application

The final application could be downloaded from github:
