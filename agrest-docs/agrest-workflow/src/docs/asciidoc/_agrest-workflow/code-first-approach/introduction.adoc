=== Introduction

The Code-First is mainly useful in Domain Driven Design. In the Code-First approach, you focus on the domain
of your application and start creating classes for your domain entity rather than creating your database (DB-First) or creating your API (Design-First) first.
And only after domain classes creating will be created a DB structure and an appropriate API specification.

With regards of creating API specification it means that the specification can automatically generated from the class sources.
This generating has to use a classes meta information that can be provided using annotations for example.

AgREST provides following annotations:

`@AgAttribute`

`@AgId`

`@AgRelationship`

`@AgResource`

If you specify by these annotations your models and resources, AgREST maven plugin will generate an API specification in openapi v.3.0 format.
